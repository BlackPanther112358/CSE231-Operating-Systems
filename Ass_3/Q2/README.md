# Interprocess Communication

We have to implement the given problem statement using the following methods:

### FIFO

We will create 2 pipes, $fifo1$ and $fifo2$ in the makefile itself, and use them to communicate between prcosses as pipes are ideally supposed to be unidirectionally. Thus, we can communicate between processes using them.

To run the program, first $cd$ into the directory and run the following command:

```make run_fifo```
